             In 2015, Shopee launched in Singapore as a social-first, mobile-centric marketplace where users can browse, shop and sell.[8] Integrated with logistical and payment support, the asset-light platform claims to make online shopping easy and secure for both sellers and buyers.[9][10]
             <br/>
             The app-based platform launched a website in order compete with other e-commerce websites in the region like Lazada, Tokopedia and AliExpress. To differentiate itself, Shopee offers online shopping security through its own escrow service called "Shopee Guarantee",[3] where it withholds payment to sellers until buyers have received their orders.[11]

             On 3 September 2019, Shopee officially opened its new six-storey regional headquarters at Singapore Science Park. The new building has 244,000 square feet (22,700 m2) of space, which can accommodate 3,000 employees and is six times larger than the previous headquarters at Ascent Building. The building was previously tenanted by WeWork in Singapore. The lease was subsequently relinquished to Shopee as a result of its rapid expansion. By doing so, it strengthens its push into the digital economy.    </div>
